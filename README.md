***Jack of all techs, Master of Go*** — Started as a kid copy-pasting Ruby scripts in RPGMaker and making cool forum banners in Photoshop. Switched to an IT oriented school, learned **QBasic, VBasic with Winforms and some HTML + CSS**, as well as **Computer Architecture and Networks**. I liked it, I was good at it and my friends were too — an excellent combo. 

Began **fullstacking¹** at 18, had a great boss who taught me the beauty of simplicity in PHP and ~JQuery~. Got really into **videogames** and **AI/ML** on college. **Started a software factory** with some friends and no money — we lasted ~**5 years** and **+30 projects**, dealing with clients, employees, money, specs and deadlines, also coding, **managing infra** and cleaning the toilets.

Since then, I've had different jobs, gigs and positions: **90% in Go, React, Python**, slowly divorcing the Frontend and specializing in everything **Backend Engineering**: `API Design & Implementation`, `Distributed Systems Architecture`, `Web Protocols`, `Cloud Infra`, `DBs`, `Observa`, `CI/CD`, `Message Brokers` and more. 


✨ **Short and simple** — Automate it once, forget about it forever — ***Patria grande, estado de bienestar, educación y mucha IA*** — Prompt Driven Design — **Proud Hufflepuff, read 4/5 of ASOIAF, organization junkie** ✨

###### ¹. Fullstacking = Front + Back + Automation + Testing + Observability + DevOps + DBs + etc...
