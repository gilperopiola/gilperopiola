# _Franco Gino Ferraguti_ üî∞

**Proud Argentino** ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è **Experto en Golang** ‚Äî Fell in love with programming 15 years ago *and the flame is still burning*. 

***Jack of all techs, master of Go.*** Started as a child copy-pasting Ruby scripts in RPGMaker, then in school I _actually_ learned with QBasic and VBasic doing Winforms. After that I began Fullstacking¬π for a job while developing Videogames and AI on college. And finally about 6 years ago I divorced the Frontend and decided to specialize in **Backend Engineering** and all it entails: `API Design & Implementation`, `Distributed Systems Architecture`, `Web Protocols`, `Cloud Infra`, `DBs`, `CI/CD`, `Message Brokers` and much more.

In **11 years of professional experience** *(even co-owned a software company)*, I have **`seen`**, **`led`**, **`developed`** and **`delivered`** all kinds of projects. In dozens of teams and alongside hundreds of teammates, in so many fields and tech stacks and roles and timezones and... Well, you get me.

I've learned the theory and have applied it on real life. **It's a never ending process though**.

> **Short and simple is best. Automate it once and forget about it forever.** ‚Äî *Patria grande, estado de bienestar, educaci√≥n y mucha IA* ‚Äî Golang Standards and Best Practices‚Ñ¢Ô∏è _with some twists_ :) ‚Äî Proud Hufflepuff, cringe culture, look me up on soundcloud.
