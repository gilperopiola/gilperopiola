# Franco Gino Ferraguti 👨‍💻

## About Me

I'm a seasoned **Golang expert** specialized in backend architecture and cloud infrastructure. With **11 years of experience** (including owning a software company), I've developed a deep understanding on how to transform an idea into a project and then into a full-fledged scalable, reliable & tested system. My stack also includes TypeScript & React for the frontend, Python for automation, and a strong foundation in database management with SQL & NoSQL. I'm also proficient in containerization and orchestration with Docker & Kubernetes.
