***Jack of all techs, Master of Go*** — Started as a kid copy-pasting Ruby scripts in RPGMaker and making forum banners with cool effects using a ~~not-so-legal~~ portable Photoshop CS4. In school I learned **QBasic**, **VBasic** doing Winforms and some **HTML + CSS**. I liked it, I was good at it and my friends were too — Which led to countless nights coding for fun and charging classmates for doing their school projects 🤫 

At 18 I began **fullstacking¹** for a job, while making **videogames** and **AI** on college. **Started a software factory** with some friends and no money — we lasted ~**5 years** and **+30 projects**, dealing with clients, employees, money, specs and deadlines, also coding, **managing infra** and cleaning the toilets.

Since then, I've had different jobs, gigs and positions: **90% in Go, React, Python**, slowly divorcing the Frontend and specializing in everything **Backend Engineering**: `API Design & Implementation`, `Distributed Systems Architecture`, `Web Protocols`, `Cloud Infra`, `DBs`, `Observa`, `CI/CD`, `Message Brokers` and more.
