# _Franco Gino Ferraguti_ üî∞

**Argentino** ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è **Experto en Golang** ‚Äî Fell in <3 with programming 15 years ago, <3 it still. 

> TLDR: Cool guy, +15 years coding, +10 working in web dev, very broad experience and skills. Go, AI, Automation, Python, Cloud Infra, etc.

***Jack of all techs, Master of Go*** ‚Äî Started as a child **copy-pasting Ruby scripts in RPGMaker** and **making forum banners with cool effects** using a ~~not-so-legal~~ portable **Photoshop** CS4. In school I learned **QBasic**, **VBasic** doing Winforms and some **HTML + CSS**. I liked it, I was good at it and my friends were too ‚Äî Which led to countless nights coding for fun and charging classmates for doing their school projects ü§´ 

**At 18** I began **fullstacking¬π** for a job, while making **videogames** and **AI** on college. **Started a software factory** with some friends and no money ‚Äî we lasted ~**5 years** and **+30 projects**, dealing with clients, employees, money, specs and deadlines, also coding, **managing infra** and cleaning the toilets. Since then, I've had different jobs, gigs and positions: **90% in Go, React, Python**, slowly divorcing the Frontend and specializing in everything **Backend Engineering**: `API Design & Implementation`, `Distributed Systems Architecture`, `Web Protocols`, `Cloud Infra`, `DBs`, `Observa`, `CI/CD`, `Message Brokers` and more.
