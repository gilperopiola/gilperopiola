# _Franco Gino Ferraguti_ üî∞

**Proud Argentino** ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è **Experto en Golang** ‚Äî Fell in love with programming 15 years ago, *flame still burning*. 

***Jack of all techs, Master of Go*** ‚Äî Started as a child **copy-pasting Ruby scripts in RPGMaker** and **making forum banners with cool effects** using a ~~not-so-legal~~ portable **Photoshop** CS4. In school I learned **QBasic**, **VBasic** doing Winforms and some **HTML + CSS**. I liked all of it, I was good at it and most of my friends were too ‚Äî Which led to countless late nights coding for fun and charging classmates $ for doing their school projects ü§´ 

**At 18** I began **fullstacking¬π** for a job, while developing **videogames** and **AI** on college. **Started a software factory** with some friends and no money ‚Äî we lasted about **5 years** and completed **+30 projects**, having to deal with clients, money, requirements and deadlines while also coding and **managing infra** (and cleaning the bathroom). Had some fullstack jobs and gigs after ‚Äî **Mostly Go and React** ‚Äî And 6 years ago I finally divorced the Frontend I had once loved and decided to specialize in everything **Backend Engineering**: `API Design & Implementation`, `Distributed Systems Architecture`, `Web Protocols`, `Cloud Infra`, `DBs`, `Observa`, `CI/CD`, `Message Brokers` and more.
