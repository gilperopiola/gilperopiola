# Franco Gino Ferraguti 🦔

Seasoned **Golang expert** specialized in backend architecture and cloud infra :). With **11 years of experience** (including owning a software company), I've developed a deep understanding on how to transform an idea into a project and then into a full-fledged scalable, reliable system. My stack also includes TypeScript & React for the frontend, Python for automation, and a strong foundation in database management, be it SQL or NoSQL. Also know my way around containerization and orchestration with Docker & Kubernetes.
